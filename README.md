# Coding Girlies

## Cat and Mouse

## Group Responsibilities

Tyreese & Liz - Enemies and Debug and Original Art
Evie - TileMap and Collisions Map
Emma - Classes (Enemy, Tiles, Player etc)
Molly and Micha - Movement and Playthrough (Arrow Key controlled)


## Our initial game idea

Our game will feature a mouse sprite that is working its way through a maze (4 different scenes, each season)

When player gets to the end of each part of the maze, the screen will swipe over to the next part.

## Our Sprites

Mouse
Each level will have another cat as an enemy following the cat - if player hits the cat = they get taken back to the beginning.
Different items for different seasons - e.g winter = snowballs
Hedges/Stones/Grass the player has to navigate around - they cannot go through it (Collision Map)

## Additional Features

We will have pieces of cheese that the player picks up as they go through the maze that increases their speed.
